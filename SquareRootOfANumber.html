// Question:-  javscript me square likhe jaise 5 hai to square root 25 aaye aur agr 25 hai to squre root 5 aaye how can i solve this puzzle in javascript
// Ans:-  To find the square root of a nunber in JavaScript, you can use the built-in           Math.sqrt()
//                  Its is syntex :-    math.sqrt(number)

var a = prompt("Please Enter a number", "");
//if we put in squrt in string that is answer should be Nan which is this is not a number it is a string  and if we put substraction like (-64) than is also result Nan Because it is not possible to make square roott
var b =Math.sqrt(a);
console.log(b);
